    `ox-hugo` is an Org exporter backend that exports Org to Hugo-compatible Markdown (Blackfriday) and also generates the front-matter (in TOML or YAML format).  
    
    If you use spacemacs, you can use `, e e H` or `SPC m e e H` to export org file to markdown.  
    For More information about spacemacs , please see [spacemacs/org](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop/layers/%2Bemacs/org).

    Manage external services from within Emacs.  
    If you use spacemacs, you can use `<SPC> a t p` to see a list of all defined services.
